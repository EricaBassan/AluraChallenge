ðŸš€ Week 01: Logistics Challenge Dashboard (AluraLog)
The Alura Log manager is facing some work changes due to the high demand of logistics services during the pandemic time. She wants to keep the quality of her service and she needs constantly follow up the KPIâ€™s to take correct decisions. To help her in this analysis a logistics dashboard was created with the following information provided by the customer dataset.



All the ETL process was done in Power Query using the main functions such as : replace values, divide columns by delimiter, change columns type, rename columns, remove empty cells with no relevant information, cleaning spaces, deleting no relevant information. In this process 4 CSV tables was refined.
